### A Kitsune PCC mod for [Elin](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2135150/Elin/)

Touch fluffy tail!

## Character Creation

Since the back slot is not available during the initial character creator you will need to either
use an import file with attachments already set, or find a mirror in-game to adjust the back slot after creation.

Included in the mod directory is a set of template characters with attachments and outfits pre-applied.

You can find the mod folder by using the `Mod Viewer` on the title screen, or from the main menu during the game. Click
the mod name and then `Open in Explorer`.
Use the files in the `Template` folder with the `Import` function in the character editor.
